# CLAUDE.md — strfry-86

## What this project is

**strfry-86** is a pure-Python moderation sidecar for a [strfry](https://github.com/hoytech/strfry) Nostr relay (repo: https://github.com/sybenx/strfry-86), deployed *inside* the operator's existing strfry Docker container with zero image changes, zero pip installs, and zero new compose services. ("86" is restaurant slang for banning someone from the establishment — fitting for a relay literally named stir fry.)

How it works, end to end:

1. The admin reports a user from any normal Nostr client (primarily jumble.social). The client publishes a NIP-56 report (`kind 1984`).
2. The strfry write-policy plugin (`plugin86.py`) sees the report. If — and only if — it is authored by the admin pubkey, every pubkey in its `p` tags is added to the blacklist. From then on, all events authored by blacklisted pubkeys are rejected.
3. A tiny stdlib web server (`server86.py`) serves a bare HTML page listing bans. The admin logs in with a NIP-07 extension and unbans via checkboxes. Unbans are authorized per-request with NIP-98 signed events — no sessions.
4. A single self-contained installer/updater (`strfry-86-updater.py`) handles first install, config, strfry.conf rewrite, and all future updates, run via one `docker exec` command.

## Hard environment constraints (do not violate)

- **Python 3 stdlib ONLY.** No pip, no venv, no third-party imports anywhere. The target is the Python that ships in the operator's strfry container. Schnorr verification and bech32 are vendored (see below).
- **Everything lives in `/config/strfry86/`** inside the container — this is on the operator's permanent `strfry_config` named volume, so it survives container recreation. Nothing is written anywhere else except the strfry.conf edit and its backup.
- **No custom Docker image, no new compose service, no entrypoint changes.** The only compose change the operator makes by hand is adding a `ports:` line for the admin page (document in README).
- **`plugin86.py` writes nothing but protocol JSON to stdout** (stderr for all logging) and never crashes on bad input — a dead plugin can wedge the relay.
- Only the admin pubkey can ban (via kind 1984) or unban (via NIP-98). No other trust roots.
- The admin pubkey can never end up in the blacklist (silent no-op on any attempt).
- admin.html styling is limited to centering + one mobile font-size media query. No fonts, no colors, no frameworks, no CDN.

```

## strfry-86-updater.py

Single file, self-contained (may not import lib86 — it must run before lib86 exists). Idempotent: safe to run any number of times. Flow:

1. **Fetch `manifest.json`** from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sybenx/strfry-86/main/` (repo base URL is a constant at the top of the file). Manifest maps relative path → sha256 for every deployable file. `config.json` and `blacklist.json` are NEVER in the manifest.
2. **Diff against local**: sha256 each local file; download only missing/changed files. Download to `<name>.tmp` then `os.replace` (atomic). Verify sha256 of each download against the manifest before installing; abort loudly on mismatch.
3. **First-run config**: if `config.json` doesn't exist, determine the admin pubkey and write `config.json` with `{"admin_pubkey_hex": ..., "port": 8686, "bind": "0.0.0.0"}`. To determine the pubkey: first try to read `relay.info.pubkey` from `/config/strfry.conf` (the NIP-11 admin contact); if found and it parses as a valid pubkey, offer it as the default — "Found relay.info.pubkey <npub...> in strfry.conf — use as admin? [Y/n]". On decline, or if the field is absent/invalid, prompt for a paste (accept npub or 64-hex; decode npub via inline bech32 — small enough to duplicate in the updater). Never silently adopt the strfry.conf value without confirmation: this key is the sole root of trust for banning. (Bind inside the container must be 0.0.0.0 for the compose port mapping to work; the README tells the operator to scope exposure via the compose `ports:` line, e.g. `127.0.0.1:8686:8686`.)
4. **strfry.conf edit**: locate `/config/strfry.conf` (constant, documented). Before any modification, copy to `strfry.conf.bak-<unixtime>`. Then:
   - If `writePolicy.plugin` already points at `/config/strfry86/plugin86.py` → no-op.
   - If it is empty/unset → set it to `plugin = "/config/strfry86/plugin86.py"`.
   - If it points at some OTHER plugin → do NOT touch it; print a loud warning telling the operator to resolve manually.
   - Edit conservatively with line-oriented matching on the `writePolicy` block; do not reformat the rest of the file.
   - When detecting whether a plugin is already configured, ignore comment lines (lines whose first non-whitespace character is `#`) — a commented-out `# plugin = ...` line is NOT an active plugin and must not trigger the refuse-to-touch path. Never modify, remove, or uncomment any comment line anywhere in the file.
5. **chmod +x** `plugin86.py` (it has a `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang; strfry executes it directly).
6. **Restart the web server**: after any successful update, find and kill any running `server86.py` (match on cmdline via `/proc`, no pgrep dependency). The next event through the plugin respawns it with fresh code. Print what was done.
7. **Self-update**: if the manifest shows the updater itself changed, download it LAST, replace atomically, and print "updater updated — already effective next run."
8. Exit with a clear summary: installed/updated/unchanged file counts, config status, strfry.conf status, and the hint "if in doubt: docker restart <container>".

## plugin86.py — strfry write policy

strfry spawns the plugin once and writes one JSON object per line to stdin; the plugin answers one JSON per line on stdout.

Input (relevant fields): `{ "type": "new", "event": { "id", "pubkey", "kind", "tags", "content", "sig", "created_at" }, ... }`
Output: `{"id": "<event id>", "action": "accept"}` or `{"id": "<event id>", "action": "reject", "msg": "blocked: banned pubkey"}`

Logic per event, in order:

1. Parse; on failure log to stderr, continue.
2. Author blacklisted → reject `"blocked: banned pubkey"`.
3. `kind == 1984` and `pubkey == admin` → for every valid `p` tag (64-char lowercase hex, validate, skip malformed), add to blacklist with `banned_at = created_at`, `report_event_id = id`, `reason = content`; then accept. Do NOT verify the signature here — strfry has already verified it, and this is the hot path.
4. Otherwise accept.

On startup (and once per hour thereafter), plugin86 ensures `server86.py` is running: spawn `python3 /config/strfry86/server86.py` fully detached (`start_new_session=True`, stdin/stdout/stderr to devnull — the plugin's stdout is sacred). server86 enforces singleton by port-bind: if the bind fails with EADDRINUSE it exits 0 silently, so repeated spawns are harmless.

Use unbuffered/line-flushed stdout. Reload the blacklist on mtime change, checked at most once per second (see lib86/blacklist.py).

## server86.py — admin page + unban API

stdlib `http.server` (ThreadingHTTPServer). Routes:

- `GET /` → `admin.html`.
- `GET /api/banned` → `{"admin": "<hex>", "banned": [{"pubkey", "npub", "banned_at", "reason"}]}`. Public read is fine.
- `POST /api/unban` → body `{"auth": <signed nostr event>, "pubkeys": ["<hex>", ...]}` → removes each, returns `{"ok": true, "removed": [...]}`.

NIP-98 auth checks for `/api/unban` — ALL must pass, else 401 JSON error:

1. Signature valid per BIP-340 over the NIP-01 serialized event id (use `lib86/bip340.py`; recompute the event id and check it matches `auth.id` before verifying the sig).
2. `auth.pubkey == admin_pubkey_hex`.
3. `auth.kind == 27235`.
4. `method` tag is `POST`; `u` tag's path is `/api/unban` (lenient on host/origin — reverse proxies change it).
5. `abs(created_at - now) <= 60`.

No sessions, cookies, or tokens.

## admin.html

Raw HTML, one vanilla `<script>` block, no libraries. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`. One `<style>` block containing ONLY: content centering (`max-width` + `margin: 0 auto`) and one media query bumping base font size on small screens. Nothing else — browser defaults throughout.

Content and behavior:

- `<h1>strfry-86</h1>`.
- Ban list loads for everyone on page load from `/api/banned`: one `<li>` per ban with a checkbox, the npub as a raw `<a href="https://njump.me/<npub>" target="_blank">` link, ban date, and reason. Insert all user-influenced strings via `textContent` (report reasons are attacker-influenced).
- "Login with extension" button → `window.nostr.getPublicKey()`. Match admin → enable unban controls; mismatch → plain text "this key is not the admin"; no `window.nostr` → plain text "a NIP-07 extension is required".
- "Unban selected" button (disabled until admin login) → build kind-27235 event with `u` + `method` tags, `window.nostr.signEvent`, POST, re-fetch, re-render.

## README.md

Must open with the one-command install, in its own fenced code block so GitHub shows the copy button (that IS the one-click copy — no HTML tricks needed):

```
docker exec -it strfry sh -c 'mkdir -p /config/strfry86 && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sybenx/strfry-86/main/strfry-86-updater.py -o /config/strfry86/strfry-86-updater.py && python3 /config/strfry86/strfry-86-updater.py'
```

Immediately followed by the update command (same thing, shorter — updater is already installed):

```
docker exec -it strfry python3 /config/strfry86/strfry-86-updater.py
```

README must also cover, briefly: adjusting the container name if not `strfry`; that the admin key is asked for once on first run (defaulting to relay.info.pubkey from strfry.conf if set) and stored in `/config/strfry86/config.json`, public key only, nsec never leaves your extension; the compose `ports:` line (`127.0.0.1:8686:8686`, with a note on tailnet/reverse-proxy exposure); adding the relay to your write relays in jumble.social so your reports actually reach it; that bans are forward-looking and existing events are purged with `strfry delete --filter '{"authors":["<hex>"]}'`; where the strfry.conf backups land; and the trust model in one honest sentence (the updater executes code from this repo's main branch — don't run someone else's fork blindly).

## Release discipline

`tools/make_manifest.py` regenerates `manifest.json` (sha256 over every deployable file, sorted keys, trailing newline). Any commit that changes a deployable file MUST regenerate the manifest — an out-of-date manifest makes the updater skip or reject files. test.sh should verify the manifest matches the working tree in addition to piping crafted JSONL through `python3 plugin86.py` and asserting accept/reject for: normal event accepted; banned author rejected; admin 1984 bans its p-tags; non-admin 1984 does not ban; admin pubkey cannot be banned.

## Vendored crypto (lib86)

- `bip340.py`: adapt the BIP-340 python reference implementation (verification path only — no signing, and strip anything requiring third-party libs). Pure integer math on secp256k1.
- `bech32.py`: adapt the BIP-173 python reference implementation; expose `npub_encode(hex) -> npub` and `npub_decode(npub) -> hex`.
- Keep upstream attribution comments in both files. These two files are the ONLY cryptography in the project; never hand-roll alternatives elsewhere.
